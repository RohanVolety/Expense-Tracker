### An expense tracker where you can tracks all your expenses of a month. All expenses would be cleared from the database on the 1st of every month.

Steps to Run the Project:

1) To Run Backend
```python


cd api
```
```bash
nodemon index.js
```

2) To Run Frontend

```bash
yarn start
```


Future Updates:

I would be adding authentication/login system so that multi-users can access the tracker at the same time.
